# Alignment of reads and variant calling, variant calling using the GATK best practices workflow

01_fastp: removing adapter sequences and low-quality bases using fastp 
02_mappings: mapping to the DM v6.1 reference genome using bwa and germline variant calling using the GATK.
03_merge: gVCF files from all samples were merged into comprehensive set of variant calls using GATK GenomicsDBImport and GenotypeGVCFs
04_filter: variants filtered using GATK VariantFiltration and vcftools
